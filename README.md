# PWC-Switzerland-PowerBi-Mini-Project

In a bustling call centre, the hum of activity never ceased as agents fielded calls from customers around the globe. Amidst this dynamic environment, our team embarked on a project to illuminate the inner workings of the call centre through data. Utilizing Microsoft Power BI, we crafted a comprehensive analysis of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics, encapsulated in a detailed PBIX file. This project became our window into the heart of the call centre, showcasing real-time updates on average handle times, customer satisfaction scores, and first call resolution rates. The interactive dashboards and detailed reports allowed stakeholders to drill down into daily and weekly performances, uncovering trends and patterns that had previously gone unnoticed. With user-friendly visualizations and intuitive filters, the data was transformed into actionable insights, empowering the team to enhance their operations and improve customer experiences. Our journey through the data not only revealed the pulse of the call centre but also provided a powerful tool for ongoing optimization and success.
